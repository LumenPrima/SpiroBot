# SpiroBot

SpiroBot is a project that combines the artistic beauty of spirographs with modern robotics and computer-aided design.

## Project Overview

SpiroBot is designed to create intricate spirograph patterns using a combination of software and hardware components. It allows users to design spirograph patterns digitally and then translate these designs into physical drawings using a robotic arm or CNC-like setup.

## Key Features

- Digital spirograph pattern designer
- G-code generation for physical drawing
- Integration with robotic drawing systems

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project
- `include/`: Header files for the project
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project
- `resources/`: Additional resources and assets

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake as its build system. To build the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
