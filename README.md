## Project Overview

SpiroBot is a project that combines the artistic beauty of spirographs with modern robotics and computer-aided design.

SpiroBot is designed to create intricate spirograph patterns using a combination of software and hardware components. It allows users to design spirograph patterns digitally and then translate these designs into physical drawings using a robotic arm or CNC-like setup.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file can be configured to set default values for the application. Please refer to this file to customize the behavior of SpiroBot for your specific setup.

## Prerequisites

### Installing Qt

SpiroBot requires Qt to be installed on your system. 

#### For Ubuntu Jammy (22.04)

You can install Qt using the package manager with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev
```

This will install the Qt6 development files and libraries necessary for building Qt applications.

#### For other systems

Follow these general steps to install Qt:

1. Visit the official Qt website: https://www.qt.io/download
2. Choose the open-source version of Qt for your operating system.
3. Download and run the Qt Online Installer.
4. During installation, select the latest Qt version (e.g., Qt 6.x) and the components you need (at minimum, select "Desktop gcc" for Linux or the equivalent for your OS).
5. Complete the installation process.

After installation, make sure to add Qt to your system's PATH environment variable:

For Linux:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/path/to/Qt/6.x.x/gcc_64/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Replace "/path/to/Qt/6.x.x" with the actual path where Qt is installed on your system.

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake as its build system. To build the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
