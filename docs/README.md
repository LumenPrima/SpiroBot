# SpiroBot Documentation

## Note on Design Drafts

The documents in this folder represent early design drafts and conceptual ideas for the SpiroBot project. It's important to note that these drafts do not necessarily reflect the current state of the project.

As the project evolves, some ideas presented in these documents may have been modified, expanded upon, or discarded. For the most up-to-date information on the project's current state and features, please refer to the main README.md file in the root directory of this repository.

These documents are retained for historical context and to provide insight into the project's development process. They may be useful for understanding the initial vision and evolution of SpiroBot.

If you're looking for current documentation or user guides, please check the main README.md or other designated documentation areas that may have been created as the project progressed.
