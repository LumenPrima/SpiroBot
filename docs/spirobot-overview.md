# SpiroBot Project: Current State and Future Enhancements

## Current State

SpiroBot is a Qt-based application for creating and visualizing spirograph patterns. The current implementation includes:

1. A main window (MainWindow) that handles the user interface and controls.
2. A drawing area (DrawingArea) that renders the spirograph patterns.
3. User-adjustable parameters:
   - Outer radius
   - Inner radius
   - Pen offset
   - Number of rotations
   - Line thickness
   - Number of pens
   - Rotation offset

The application allows real-time updates of the spirograph as the user adjusts these parameters, providing immediate visual feedback.

## Core Components

1. MainWindow: Manages the UI elements and user interactions.
2. DrawingArea: Handles the rendering of the spirograph patterns using QPainter.
3. CMake build system for cross-platform compatibility.

## Current Features

- Interactive UI with sliders and spin boxes for parameter adjustment.
- Real-time updating of the spirograph as parameters change.
- Support for multiple pens with different colors.
- Adjustable line thickness.
- Rotation offset for creating varied patterns.

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Color Customization**: 
   - Allow users to choose custom colors for each pen.
   - Implement gradient color options for single-pen designs.

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - Add the ability to export designs as SVG or PNG files.
   - Implement a feature to generate gcode for use with drawing robots.

3. **Save and Load Designs**:
   - Create a file format to save spirograph configurations.
   - Implement save and load functionality for user designs.

4. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Add the ability to undo and redo parameter changes.

5. **Animation**:
   - Implement an animation feature to show the drawing process.

6. **Advanced Gear Shapes**:
   - Allow for custom gear shapes beyond circular gears.

7. **Layer System**:
   - Implement a layer system for combining multiple spirograph patterns.

8. **Randomize Function**:
   - Add a button to randomize parameters for unexpected designs.

9. **Preset Designs**:
   - Include a library of preset spirograph designs.

10. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Optimize drawing algorithms for smoother performance with complex patterns.

11. **Mobile Version**:
    - Adapt the application for mobile devices using Qt for Android/iOS.

12. **User Accounts and Cloud Sync**:
    - Implement user accounts and cloud storage for designs.

13. **Community Features**:
    - Add the ability to share designs with other users.

14. **3D Spirographs**:
    - Extend the concept to 3D, allowing for the creation of 3D spirograph patterns.

These enhancements would significantly expand the capabilities of SpiroBot, making it a more powerful and versatile tool for creating spirograph designs.
