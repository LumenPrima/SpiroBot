# Spirograph Simulation and Gcode Conversion Project - Design Requirements

## 1. Overview
This project aims to create a software application that simulates spirograph patterns and converts them into gcode for use with drawing robots. The application will provide an intuitive interface for users to create, visualize, and export spirograph patterns, as well as convert these patterns into gcode instructions.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Pattern Generation
- Implement mathematical models for accurate spirograph pattern generation
- Support the following user-adjustable parameters:
  - Outer gear size (radius)
  - Inner gear size (radius)
  - Pen hole distance from center of inner gear
  - Number of rotations to complete the pattern
- Allow for multiple pen hole positions in the inner gear
- Support both epitrochoid and hypotrochoid patterns
- Implement a system for custom gear shapes beyond circular gears

### 2.2 Visualization
- Provide a real-time preview of the pattern as parameters are adjusted
- Implement zooming and panning controls for the preview area
- Display a progress indicator during pattern generation
- Show a visual representation of the gears and their movement
- Offer an option to animate the drawing process

### 2.3 Export Options
- Save patterns as vector graphics (SVG format)
- Export patterns as raster images (PNG, JPEG) with adjustable resolution
- Provide an option to export the mathematical equation of the pattern

### 2.4 Gcode Conversion
- Transform vector paths into gcode commands
- Support common gcode dialects used by popular drawing robots (e.g., Marlin, Grbl)
- Allow configuration of robot-specific parameters:
  - Drawing area dimensions
  - Maximum speed and acceleration
  - Pen up/down commands
  - Tool offset
- Optimize the generated gcode for efficient drawing (minimize unnecessary movements)
- Provide options for scaling and positioning the pattern within the robot's drawing area

### 2.5 User Interface
- Design an intuitive and responsive graphical user interface
- Implement real-time updating of the preview as parameters are changed
- Provide preset patterns and the ability to save/load custom configurations
- Include a help section with explanations of spirograph concepts and application usage
- Implement undo/redo functionality for parameter changes

### 2.6 File Management
- Save and load project files containing all pattern parameters
- Automatically save backups of the current project
- Implement a gallery view of saved patterns

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- Ensure smooth real-time updates of the preview for patterns up to 100,000 points
- Optimize calculations to handle complex patterns without noticeable lag
- Complete gcode conversion for standard patterns (up to 50,000 points) within 5 seconds on a mid-range computer

### 3.2 Compatibility
- Develop as a cross-platform application supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Ensure compatibility with common drawing robots and CNC machines
- Design a modular architecture to allow easy addition of new gcode dialects or export formats

### 3.3 Usability
- Design an intuitive interface suitable for both beginners and advanced users
- Provide tooltips and contextual help throughout the application
- Ensure the application is accessible, following WCAG 2.1 AA standards where applicable

### 3.4 Security
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks when processing user inputs
- Ensure secure file handling to prevent unauthorized access to user data

### 3.5 Scalability
- Design the application architecture to allow for future additions of new features and pattern types
- Implement a plugin system for user-created extensions

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Development
- Use a cross-platform framework such as Qt or Electron for the application development
- Implement core algorithms in C++ for performance, with a higher-level language like Python or JavaScript for the UI
- Use OpenGL or a similar graphics library for efficient pattern rendering
- Employ vector mathematics libraries for accurate and efficient calculations

### 4.2 Testing
- Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering all core functions
- Implement integration tests for the gcode conversion process
- Perform usability testing with a diverse group of potential users

### 4.3 Documentation
- Provide inline code documentation following industry standard practices
- Create user documentation including a quick start guide and full manual
- Develop technical documentation for future maintenance and extensions

## 5. Future Considerations
- Integration with cloud services for pattern sharing and collaborative editing
- Mobile app version for on-the-go pattern creation
- Direct integration with drawing robot firmware for immediate pattern execution
- Support for 3D spirograph patterns and corresponding 3D printer gcode generation

## 6. Deliverables
- Source code of the application
- Compiled executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- User documentation and technical documentation
- Test suite and test results
- Project roadmap for future development

## 7. Timeline
- Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Core algorithm development and basic UI
- Phase 2 (Month 3-4): Advanced features and gcode conversion
- Phase 3 (Month 5): Testing, optimization, and documentation
- Phase 4 (Month 6): Beta testing, bug fixes, and release preparation

This comprehensive design requirement document should provide a solid foundation for creating the spirograph simulation and gcode conversion project.
